## Milestone 4
### Get the Zumo to navigate a simple maze with no branching (only one path) and stop when it reaches the end goal

## Milestone 5
### Get the Zumo to solve a maze with branching

## Milestone 6
### Get the Zumo to solve a maze with branching and then repeat the maze and follow a memorized path

## Milestone 7
### Have a final run in the practice maze of under XX seconds. (Will set this time once I have a practice maze up and running...)
