## Milestones
- [x] Milestone 1- Create your own code that moves the Zumo at least 4 feet
- [x] Milestone 2- Get the Zumo to follow a line on the floor for at least 4 feet
- [x] Milestone 3- Get the Zumo to follow a line along 2' x 2' square. (Create a square using the tape, 2ft on each side. Place the Zumo anywhere on the square and get it to follow the square for at least a full lap.)
- [x] Milestone 4- Get the Zumo to navigate a simple maze with no branching (only one path) and stop when it reaches the end goal
- [x] Milestone 5- Get the Zumo to solve a maze with branching
- [x] Milestone 6- Get the Zumo to solve a maze with branching and then repeat the maze and follow a memorized path
- [x] Milestone 7 Have a final run in the practice maze of under XX seconds. (Will set this time once I have a practice maze up and running...)

Process:
In the rules we're told we're only timed for the second run of the maze meaning we can autonomously map the maze out for as long as we like. This means time improvements must come through efficent movements (moving the robot at max speed, speeding up where we know we don't need to turn), short sensor pauses (as soon as you read a turn or intersection use ballastic movement to immediately take a turn), and an optimal shortest path algorithm (though the one given seems sufficient).

Consult tutorial code for format and variable names. This way the logic will translate to the next tutorial.

With this in mind my goal is to code for myself, make it match with the tutorials if the tutorials run better, and then play around with the end result looking for optimizations, max speed, and in order to get a good enough understanding of the code to make notebook entries of my understanding of the code and gain the ability to better modify it once I reach milestone 7.
