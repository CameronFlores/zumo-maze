# Milestone 7
## Get the Zumo to solve a maze with branching and then repeat the maze and follow a memorized path
In the rules we're told we're only timed for the second run of the maze meaning we can autonomously map the maze out for as long as we like. This means improvements must come through efficent movements (moving the robot at max speed, speeding up where we know we don't need to turn), short sensor pauses (as soon as you read a turn or intersection use ballastic movement to immediately take a turn), and an optimal short path finder.
