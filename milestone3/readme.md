# Milestone 3
## Get the Zumo to follow a line along 2' x 2' square. (Create a square using the tape, 2ft on each side. Place the Zumo anywhere on the square and get it to follow the square for at least a full lap.)

## Notes
### Max Speed
Again I found a 300 BASE_SPEED reliable when following the line though I was able to half time of the tutorial's ballistic turning by speeding up the motors to 500.

### Hybrid turns
Intuitively I believe that hybrid turns (mentioned in the tutorial) won't be as efficient as a ballistic turn. Evident from the tutorial, time spent slowing down the zumo to sense lines is time wasted. While accuracy is a concern ballistic turns are the fastest choice and since we are given infinite retries doing a speed run is simply a matter of calibrating and getting lucky. Unless my zumo starts to wear down and act unexpectedly I believe I'll be sticking with ballastic turns.

## Problems
A problem I may have to address later on is overshooting my turns. I believe there is an instance in the video where the robot turned too far and took more time to calibrate itself. In earlier attempts overshot turns even caused the zumo to do a 180 and ignore the turn.
