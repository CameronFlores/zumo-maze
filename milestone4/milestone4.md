# Milestone 4
## Get the Zumo to navigate a simple maze with no branching (only one path) and stop when it reaches the end goal
This milestone is simply a matter of combining the previous milestones and adding a right turn function.

## Notes
### Max Speed
To get the zumo up the max speed we use the same reasoining from the previous milestones. 
Going straight we go up to 300 so that we can read turns correctly. 
When turning we can go up to 500 as to half the tutorial's turning time and callibrate it as variables change.
### Goal stop
Stop at T branch (we sense black on all sensors)

## Problems
As this is just combining the previous milestones there are no new problems.
