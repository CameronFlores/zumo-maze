# Milestone 2
## Get the Zumo to follow a line on the floor for at least 4 feet

## Proof


## Notes
### Max Speed
While I found no need to greatly change the proportion gain I found that 300 was a reliable BASE_SPEED. 

## Problems
This milestone is of little concern for me as the maze will have straight lines, our code only needs to handle miniscule centering. What I take away from this is that I may be able to speed up the zumo to 400 when I give it straight lines.
