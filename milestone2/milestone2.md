# Milestone 2
## Get the Zumo to follow a line on the floor for at least 4 feet

## Proof


## Notes
### Max Speed
While I found no need to greatly change the proportion gain I found that 300 was a reliable BASE_SPEED. 

## Problems
### Callibration
While I was able to get the zumo to move and even turn the way I wanted it to I was unable to get it to follow a line. After consulting the tutorial I learned about callibration as well as how to read data from line sensors.
### Takeaway
Exploring the follow_line function wasn't much of a concern to me as the maze will have straight lines, our code only needs to handle miniscule centering as opposed to the curved lines shown in the tutorial. What I take away from this is that I may be able to speed up the zumo to 400 when I give it straight lines.
